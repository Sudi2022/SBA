Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether a loan should be approved or denied using data from the Small Business Administration (SBA) National Data. The goal is to provide insights to lending institutions for better decision-making processes.

Data:
The project utilizes the SBA National Data for predictive modeling.

Data Preprocessing:
•	Handle Missing Data
•	Feature Scaling
•	Categorical Encoding
•	Feature Engineering (Variable Selection, Interaction Terms)

Train-Test Split:
The data is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

Feature Selection/Engineering:
Various techniques are employed for feature selection and engineering to enhance model performance.

Model Development:
Multiple classification models are developed and evaluated:
•	kNN
•	Classification Trees
•	Logit Model (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet)
•	Neural Networks
•	Discriminant Analysis

Model Evaluation and Selection:
Models are evaluated using:
•	Confusion Matrix
•	Cost/Gain Matrix

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Grid Search/Random Search is performed for hyperparameter tuning.

Final Model Evaluation:
The final model's performance is evaluated, and net profit calculations are performed.

Interpretation and Documentation:
The models are interpreted, and documentation is provided for insights and understanding.

Gains and Lift Charts:
Gains and lift charts are generated for model evaluation.

Comparison of the Models:
Models are compared based on accuracy, sorted in ascending order.
